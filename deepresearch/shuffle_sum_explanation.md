Below is a step‐by‐step explanation of how __shfl_down_sync works during a warp-level reduction. Let’s assume a warp of 32 threads, where each thread initially holds a value (say, v₀, v₁, …, v₃₁). The reduction loop typically looks like this:

```cpp
for (int offset = warpSize/2; offset > 0; offset /= 2) {
    v += __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, v, offset);
}
```

We’ll go through each iteration:

---

### **Initial State:**
- **Warp:** 32 threads with lane IDs 0 through 31.
- **Values:**  
  - Thread 0: v₀  
  - Thread 1: v₁  
  - …  
  - Thread 31: v₃₁

Each thread holds its individual value in a register variable `v`.

---

### **Iteration 1: offset = 16**

- **Operation:** Each thread calls  
  ```cpp
  v_new = v + __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, v, 16);
  ```
- **What Happens:**  
  - **Threads 0–15:**  
    - Thread 0 receives the value from thread 0+16 (i.e. thread 16) and computes:  
      **v₀' = v₀ + v₁₆**
    - Thread 1 computes:  
      **v₁' = v₁ + v₁₇**
    - …  
    - Thread 15 computes:  
      **v₁₅' = v₁₅ + v₃₁**
  - **Threads 16–31:**  
    - For these threads, lane index + 16 would exceed the warp width (or is not defined within the active mask), so __shfl_down_sync returns an undefined value (typically, these threads do not contribute to the final reduction and their results aren’t used later).

- **Result After Iteration:**  
  - Threads 0–15 now hold partial sums (each is the sum of two original values).  
  - Threads 16–31 are essentially ignored for further reduction (or hold their original values, but they won’t be used because subsequent steps only use lanes 0–15).

---

### **Iteration 2: offset = 8**

- **Operation:** Now, each thread in the lower half of the active lanes (lanes 0–7) does:  
  ```cpp
  v_new = v (from previous step) + __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, v, 8);
  ```
- **What Happens:**  
  - **Threads 0–7:**  
    - Thread 0 receives the value from thread 0+8 (i.e. thread 8, which after iteration 1 holds v₈ + v₂₄) and computes:  
      **v₀'' = (v₀ + v₁₆) + (v₈ + v₂₄)**
    - Thread 1 computes:  
      **v₁'' = (v₁ + v₁₇) + (v₉ + v₂₅)**
    - …  
    - Thread 7 computes:  
      **v₇'' = (v₇ + v₂₃) + (v₁₅ + v₃₁)**
  - **Threads 8–15:**  
    - They get values from threads 16–23 (or similar) but these are not used later as only the first 8 lanes (0–7) continue.

- **Result After Iteration:**  
  - Threads 0–7 now each hold the sum of 4 original values.
  
---

### **Iteration 3: offset = 4**

- **Operation:** Each thread in lanes 0–3 does:  
  ```cpp
  v_new = v (from previous step) + __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, v, 4);
  ```
- **What Happens:**  
  - **Threads 0–3:**  
    - Thread 0 receives the value from thread 0+4 (i.e. thread 4) and computes:  
      **v₀''' = (v₀ + v₁₆ + v₈ + v₂₄) + (v₄ + v₂₀ + v₁₂ + v₂₈)**
    - Thread 1, 2, 3 similarly sum values from their corresponding partners.
  - **Threads 4–7:**  
    - Their results are not used in the final step.
    
- **Result After Iteration:**  
  - Threads 0–3 now each hold the sum of 8 original values.

---

### **Iteration 4: offset = 2**

- **Operation:** Each thread in lanes 0–1 does:  
  ```cpp
  v_new = v + __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, v, 2);
  ```
- **What Happens:**  
  - **Threads 0 and 1:**  
    - Thread 0 receives from thread 0+2 (i.e. thread 2) and computes:  
      **v₀'''' = (sum of 8 values from iteration 3 at thread 0) + (sum of 8 values from thread 2)**
  - **Threads 2–3:**  
    - Their values are no longer used.
  
- **Result After Iteration:**  
  - Threads 0 and 1 hold the sum of 16 original values each.

---

### **Iteration 5: offset = 1**

- **Operation:** Finally, thread 0 performs:  
  ```cpp
  v_new = v + __shfl_down_sync(0xffffffff, v, 1);
  ```
- **What Happens:**  
  - **Thread 0:**  
    - Receives the value from thread 0+1 (i.e. thread 1) and adds it, so thread 0 now holds the sum of all 32 values in the warp.
  - **Thread 1:**  
    - Its result is not used further.
  
- **Final Result:**  
  - **Thread 0** of the warp now contains the sum of all the initial values from threads 0 through 31.  
  - Typically, this is the value you then use (e.g., write out using an atomic operation) to contribute to a global reduction.

---

### **Key Points:**
- **Mask (0xffffffff):**  
  All 32 threads are active. The mask ensures that the shuffle operation only involves active threads.
  
- **__shfl_down_sync Operation:**  
  It takes a value from a thread that is `offset` lanes below the current thread. If the thread’s lane plus the offset exceeds the warp boundary, the result is undefined (and typically ignored by the reduction logic).
  
- **Reduction Loop:**  
  By halving the number of active lanes in each iteration, the reduction efficiently sums the values within the warp.

### **Summary Diagram Example for a Warp of 8 Threads (Simpler Case):**

Suppose we have a warp of 8 threads (for clarity) with initial values:  
```
Lane:    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
Value:  v0  v1  v2  v3  v4  v5  v6  v7
```
Reduction loop (assuming warpSize=8):

1. **Iteration 1 (offset = 4):**  
   - Lane 0: v0 + v4  
   - Lane 1: v1 + v5  
   - Lane 2: v2 + v6  
   - Lane 3: v3 + v7  
   - Lanes 4–7: not used
  
2. **Iteration 2 (offset = 2):**  
   - Lane 0: (v0 + v4) + (v2 + v6) [lane 0 gets value from lane 0+2]  
   - Lane 1: (v1 + v5) + (v3 + v7) [lane 1 gets value from lane 1+2]  
   - Lanes 2–3: not used
  
3. **Iteration 3 (offset = 1):**  
   - Lane 0: {[(v0+v4)+(v2+v6)] + [(v1+v5)+(v3+v7)]}  
   - Final sum is now in lane 0.

The same principle extends to a warp of 32 threads.
